# JetFire.js
JetFire is a YARLF ( YET ANOTHER RAILS LIKE FRAMEWORK ). It uses conventions learnt from rails and aims to be a rails alternative to JS Ninjas out there. It has a full stack MVC and a lot of features on the way.

# Installation

Through npm : 
```sh
sudo npm install jetfire -g
```

# Creating a new app

```sh
jetfire new jetapp
```

# Starting up the server

```sh
# cd into the app folder
cd jetapp

# start the server
jetfire server
```

Now open up your favorite browser ( and i am sure its not IE :P ) and navigate to localhost:3000.
This is the default jetfire homepage.

Now, lets start building our jetfire powered application. I promise it'll be fn ;)
